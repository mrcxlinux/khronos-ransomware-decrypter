# Khronos Ransomware Decrypter

### First Of All - A bit of backstory
Back in July 2023 I began to mess around with malware and created a ransomware family of my own - AGAMEMNON.

The last ransomware variant I created was Khronos and I uploaded it to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/8a67095ffe3b50eadae2a474ab6dbb691fb6e50784c8f6e569da9a0a7cff7135/detection) (big mistake, I know).

Fast forward to April 2025, I randomly decided to search my username on Google and found [this](https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/27308-khronos-ransomware) article from PCRisk and the sample on [virus.exchange](https://virus.exchange/samples/18288565).

The ransom note is fully fake; I don't even own Bitcoins. No one ever contacted me on Telegram because no one got infected. And even if someone would've contacted me, I would've given them the decrypter for free.

I have NEVER distributed my ransomware or ever will. Please do not use Combo Cleaner advertised by the people who found this on VT. Use the original *free* and *safe* decrypter. 

I only made these for fun and with no intention to infect anyone and profit.

### Okay, how do I decrypt now?

I am going to repeat this - do not use other software. I am not saying that all of them are bad, some of them maybe can decrypt this but they will shove unnecessary software / purchases down your throat.

To use the decrypter made by me, simply go to releases and download the source code. Extract the zip file in which you should find three files:

    1. Decypter.exe
    2. privateKey.yashma
    3. publicKey.yashma

You have to make sure that these three files are in the same directory with the exact same filename (except the numbering / do not double the extension)

Then just run ```Decrypter.exe``` and you should be free

P.S. Sorry if you got infected
